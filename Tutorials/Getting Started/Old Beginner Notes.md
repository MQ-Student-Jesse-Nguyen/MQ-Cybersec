# Pen-testing for Beginners (Targetted for PACE Students)

## Setup a Vulnhub lab

- Root Me
    - Chooses Vulnhub box and setups for you
    - Slower but is still good
    - Limited boxes
- Local VM Network
    - Good if you're practicing pentesting by yourself.
    - Fast
    - Have to setup network (Longer setup)
        - Firewall settings for others to access VM
    - [Setting up Local Lab Tutorial](https://www.vulnhub.com/lab/software/vm/)
    - Use of dedicated machine will be better rather than a player hosting the vulnerable machine due to performance issues.

## Linux Command Line

- [Ubuntu Tutorials](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
- Practice using Linux Command line in terms of pentesting
    - [Bandit - Overthewire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
        - SSH Wargame

## Web Pen-Testing

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
    - Information about critical security risks
        - What the vulnerability is
        - PoC (Proof of Concept)
        - Cheat sheets for testing the vulnerabilities on actual applications
        - Mitigation
- Practice Web Pentesting basics
