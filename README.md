# MQ Cybersec

Welcome to Macquarie Cybersec Society!

Here you will find resources on how to hack :)

Specifically:
- Resources on how to get started
- Challenges
- Projects
- Write-ups
- Tutorials

This is only the start and we will be continuing to fill up this repository as we develop.

Going to put a flag in the first commit incase I make a CTF in the future :)
