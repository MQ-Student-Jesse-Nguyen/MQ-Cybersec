# Welcome to Macquarie University Cybersec Society!

Right now, we are based as a sub-group within the MACs (Macquarie Association for Computing Students) Society so find us in the #cybersec channel within the discord server. You will see someone called Jesse talking alot there. Feel free to DM me with any questions or you can just tag me on the channel.

**What is MQCybersec and what is the purpose of this society?**

We are a group of CTF enthusiasts who are passionate about Cybersecurity and want to share our own knowledge with the rest of Macquarie University as well as bringing together the hidden hackers that lurk in the shadows. CTFs are super fun and we want to share that fun as well as giving everyone a better chance of actually getting to know the practical side of Cybersecurity while still considering the ethical aspects. By creating this group we hope to encourage students to get interested into Cybersecurity and create a community where we can guide and support each other to build ourselves into l33t Cybersecurity professionals.

**I'm interested in Cybersecurity but I don't know how to hack at all... Am I meant to be here?**

Yes if you're interested in playing CTFs or actually learning how to exploit vulnerabilities. This society was built with the purpose to introduce people to hacking and the world of Cybersecurity. It is hard to put your foot in the door with Cybersecurity and I hope that this society will be that bridge that obstructs people from falling off the cliff to continual confusion on what hacking is. If you are still confused or have questions, feel free to contact me on the MACs discord server or by my email (jesse.nguyen@mq.edu.au).

Check out "Tutorials/Getting Started" in this repository to find resources on how to get started.

**What do we actually do in this society?**

Basically, we learn to hack.

*CTFS*

Specifically, we partipate in competitions called CTFs (Capture the Flags), where there is a set of challenges to solve and to complete each challenge, you have to obtain a flag (which is just a certain word/phrase). Each challenge will contain 1 or more vulnerabilities that you will have to exploit and is a great way to learn about certain vulnerabilities as well as actually practice the exploitation of the vulnerability to have a better understanding on how the vulnerability works.

You can think of CTFs as a bunch of puzzles given to you and when you solve each challenge, you get a flag which is worth points. CTFs introduce a competitive aspect to Cybersecurity which is always great to motivate students into learning in preparation for these CTFs.

We participate as a team on online CTFs found on CTF Time (https://ctftime.org/) and work together to get as many flags as we can.

We also have our own yearly CTF at Macquarie University called "Hack Mac" which is something that members will be training for as well. Additional CTFs may be created during the year based on the amount of participants.

*Workshops*

Occassionally, members (such as myself) will host workshops that are basically like tutorials to teach about a certain vulnerability. This workshop may include:

- Small presentation
- Demonstration of vulnerability
- Mini-CTF setup based on the vulnerability

This is a good way to practice presentation skills and also a great way to teach beginners new vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity is a continual learning journey and teaching is an essential part of learning to ensure you understand the content well.
