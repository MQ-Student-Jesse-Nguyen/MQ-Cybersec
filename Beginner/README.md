# Pen-testing for Beginners

## Setup a Vulnhub lab

- Root Me
    - Chooses Vulnhub box and setups for you
    - Slower but is still good
    - Limited boxes
- Local VM Network
    - Good if you're practicing pentesting by yourself.
    - Fast
    - Have to setup network (Longer setup)
        - Firewall settings for others to access VM

    - Use of dedicated machine will be better rather than a player hosting the vulnerable machine due to performance issues.
