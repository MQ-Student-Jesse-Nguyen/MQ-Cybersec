# Vulnhub for Beginners

## Setup the vulnerable lab

- Root Me
    - Chooses Vulnhub box and setups for you
    - Slower but is still good
    - Limited boxes
- Local VM Network
    - Good if you're practicing pentesting by yourself.
    - Fast
    - Have to setup network (Longer setup)
        - Firewall settings for others to access VM
    - ![https://www.vulnhub.com/lab/software/vm/](Setting up Local Lab Tutorial)
    - Use of dedicated machine will be better rather than a player hosting the vulnerable machine due to performance issues.
